<h2>Some History</h2>


<p>SAWJa (Static Analysis Workshop for Java) is initially a fork
from Javalib 1.8.1 where the code concerning the program
representation and manipulation, coded by Laurent Hubert and Nicolas
Barre, has been moved from Javalib to this library.  The main
improvements over Javalib 1.8.1 include the bytecode transformations
(coded by Delphine Demange and David Pichardie), the overall
efficiency (more lazy stuff, indexed data, caches, etc.) and the
cleanner interfaces and documentation.</p>
