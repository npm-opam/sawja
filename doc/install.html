<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
  The installation procedure is similar to Javalib.  Moreover, you must install
  Javalib before installing Sawja.

<p>
  (optional:) The performance of the XTA class analysis can be boosted by using
  BuDDy (a BDD package).  To enable this, you have to download <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/buddy/">BuDDy</a>, apply the patch
  <span class="code">buddycaml/patch</span> on the source files and
  compile/install them.  Finally, use <span class="code">./configure.sh</span>
  with option <span class="code">-b yes</span> when compiling Sawja.
