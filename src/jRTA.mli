(** [parse_program ~instantiated ~other_entrypoints classpath cms]
    first returns a [program] composed of all the code found in
    [classpath] and that may be accessible from at least one method of
    [cms::other_entrypoints]. [classpath] is a list of directories
    and [.jar] or [.zip] files separated with ':' (or ';' under
    Windows).  [cms] is the
    {!Javalib_pack.JBasics.class_method_signature} that represents the
    main entrypoint of the program. If [other_entrypoints] is not
    specified, the default methods are the methods invoked natively by
    the JVM during its initialization. (cf {!default_entrypoints}).
    [instantiated] is the list of classes that may be instantiated
    natively by the JVM, if it is not specified it includes the class
    [java.lang.Class] (always instantiated by JVM) and
    {!default_native_throwable}. The second return parameter is the
    set of instantiated classes calculated by RTA algorithm. *)

(** Sun's JVM calls some methods natively during the JVM
    initialization.  We have included the list (that we suppose
    complete but without guarantee). Some of the method listed may not
    exists (as <clinit> method are optionals) but there should be
    executed in this order. *)
