Installation

   The installation procedure is similar to Javalib. Moreover, you must
   install Javalib before installing Sawja.

   (optional:) The performance of the XTA class analysis can be boosted by
   using BuDDy (a BDD package). To enable this, you have to download
   [1]BuDDy, apply the patch buddycaml/patch on the source files and
   compile/install them. Finally, use ./configure.sh with option -b yes
   when compiling Sawja.
